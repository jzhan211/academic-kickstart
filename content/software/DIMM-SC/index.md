summary: "A novel method for clustering droplet-based single cell RNA-seq data."
---

DIMMSC is an R package for clustering droplet-based single cell transcriptomic data. It uses Dirichlet mixture prior to characterize variations across different clusters. An expectation-maximization algorithm is used for parameter inference. This package can provide clustering uncertainty.

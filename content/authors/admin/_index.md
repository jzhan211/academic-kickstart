I am an Associate Professor of [Pediatrics](https://www.pediatrics.pitt.edu/people/wei-chen-phd) (primary, with Tenure), [Biostatistics](https://www.publichealth.pitt.edu/home/directory/wei-chen) (secondary), [Human Genetics](https://www.publichealth.pitt.edu/home/directory/wei-chen) (secondary), and [Biomedical Informatics](https://www.dbmi.pitt.edu/node/52286) (secondary) at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/) and the Director of Statistical Genetics Core at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. My lab is interested in the development of statistical and computational methods for high-throughput genetic/genomic data (e.g. next-generation sequencing, methylation, RNA-seq data, and single cell sequencing) and the genetic study of complex diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), childhood asthma, and chronic obstructive pulumonary disease (COPD). Our lab is currently supported by the University of Pittsburgh, National Eye Institute (NEI), National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). A research summary can be found [here]({{< ref "/research/_index.md" >}}). We are actively looking for local and distant collaborations.

Postdoc positions are available [here]({{< ref "/positions/index.md" >}}). Positions for graduate student research assistants and undergraduate student workers are also available. Rotation students are also welcome. Please contact Wei Chen at wei.chen@chp.edu for more information.
